                <p class="drop-cap">Nobody tells you it starts with a gut punch. Before a single line of code is written, before you've even cracked open a text editor, the instructor stands up and informs you that <strong>the field is oversaturated with people who don't know what they're doing</strong> — and that learning to code will only be a small slice of what actually gets you hired. Half the people who landed jobs through this program didn't even have a technical interview. Half. Let that marinate.</p>

                <p>Welcome to #100Devs. Buy the ticket, take the ride.</p>

                    "Clicking 'Apply' on job boards is like lighting your resume on fire."

                </blockquote>

                <p>This isn't a coding bootcamp. That's the first thing to understand — and it was repeated so many times across both classes that my notes started to look like a manifesto. <strong>This is a jobs program.</strong> The code is the vehicle; the job is the destination. And the engine that actually moves you forward? Networking. Community. Consistency. Showing up when you don't feel like it.</p>

                <p>Class 2 opened with the declaration: <em>"We are all Beyoncé."</em> And you know what? I believe it. Not because the vibes are immaculate (they are), but because Beyoncé doesn't leave anything to chance. She plans. She executes. She doesn't trip. That's the energy we're supposed to bring to this.</p>

                    <h3>The Mission</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Two classes in and the curriculum is already firing on multiple levels. The technical content is real — we touched the client-server model, the three pillars of the web, semantic HTML — but the meta-curriculum is just as heavy: <em>how to learn, how to stay in the game, how to not fall apart when it gets hard.</em></p>

                <p>The web has three pillars. HTML is the skeleton — structure, content, the bones of everything. CSS is the skin — it makes the bones look like something. JavaScript is the organs — the behavior, the interactivity, the thing that makes it alive. <strong>Separation of Concerns</strong> means you keep them in separate files. Why? Organization. Readability. So when something breaks at 2am you're not drowning in one unholy file of spaghetti. (Leon would never.)</p>

&lt;!-- The correct ritual --&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is content that means something.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <p class="spell-note">Why it matters: Semantic HTML isn't just being a good citizen — it's Google actually indexing your work, screen readers actually reading it, and clients getting the accessibility compliance they need. Also, morally, we are mandated to do good. That's the rule.</p>
                </div>

                <p>We also did <strong>Lab #1: Brownies.</strong> A humble HTML recipe page. Sounds simple until you're staring at the VS Code hints in the comments and realizing the whole point isn't the brownies — it's learning to read documentation, follow structure, and not panic. We were warned: no extensions yet. Learn the manual way first so you know what the tools are actually doing.</p>

                <p>Both classes circled back to this: the emotional journey of learning to code has a known shape. There's an initial high — you're excited, everything clicks, you feel like you could build Instagram by Tuesday. And then. <em>The trough.</em></p>

                <p>It's the period where nothing makes sense, the excitement has worn off, and the gap between what you want to make and what you can actually make feels like the Grand Canyon. Most people quit here. The whole program is essentially an elaborate, community-powered machine for getting you through to the other side.</p>

                    <h3>The Learning Ritual</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Here's the part that broke my note-taking brain: <strong>you're not supposed to take notes.</strong> Traditional notes are a trap. Reading something, highlighting it, and feeling like you've learned it is a lie your brain tells you. The science backs this up — go take Dr. Barbara Oakley's "Learning How to Learn" (free, Coursera, will rewire how you study everything).</p>

                <p><strong>Active Recall</strong> means you read something once, close the notes, and force yourself to reconstruct what you just consumed. The struggle to remember IS the learning. The friction is the point.</p>

                <p><strong>Spaced Repetition</strong> means you don't cram. You review at increasing intervals — right before you'd forget it. The tool: <strong>Anki</strong> (apps.ankiweb.net). Free. The whole program can be done without spending a dollar, and anyone who tells you otherwise is selling something.</p>

                <p>The note-taking shift: instead of writing facts, write <em>questions.</em> "What is spaced repetition?" is a better note than "spaced repetition = reviewing at intervals." One is passive. One makes you a developer.</p>

                <p>Two classes in, and the shape of this thing becomes clear: it's a program designed to produce people who know how to learn, how to network, and how to survive the psychological gauntlet of becoming a developer — and somewhere in there, they also learn to write code. The code is almost secondary. That's the most counterintuitive thing about it.</p>

                <p>The motto is <strong>"We Don't Get Got. We Go Get."</strong> Which means: don't let the overwhelm take you. Don't let the trough swallow you. Be proactive. Be intentional. Make the time — don't find it. Plan the month. Put it on the calendar. Show up when you don't feel like it.</p>
